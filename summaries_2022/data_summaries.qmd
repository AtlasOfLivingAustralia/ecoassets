EcoAssets brings together environmental data collected from three national research infrastructures - the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), and Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Infrastructure (TERN). By standardising the formats of these data resources and making them readily available, information can be streamlined into integrated data assets to support Australia's environmental reporting needs.

This document outlines the workflow involved in creating these integrated data assets for assessing biodiversity and monitoring effort across Australia.

# Data assets for Australian Biodiversity

This document outlines the workflow involved in creating three data summaries of occurrence records in the ALA. This workflow consists of initial filtering and summarising using SQL in AWS Athena, followed by joining and further aggregating of records using R.
