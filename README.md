EcoAssets
================

[EcoAssets](https://ecoassets.org.au) brings together environmental data
collected from three national research infrastructures - the Atlas of
Living Australia (ALA), Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), and
Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Infrastructure (TERN). By standardising
the formats of these data resources and making them readily accessible,
EcoAssets is working to deliver open integrated data to support
environmental assessment and reporting needs.
