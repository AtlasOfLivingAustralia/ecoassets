# ecoassets
This is the GitHub repository associated with the [EcoAssets](https://ecoassets.org.au) project. EcoAssets brings together environmental data collected from three national research infrastructures: the ALA, IMOS, and TERN. By standardising the formats of these data resources and making them readily accessible, EcoAssets is working to deliver open integrated data to support environmental assessment and reporting needs.
